# Instructions
Code and raw data for the paper "Electrochemical analysis of biological electron transport in native membranes"

Extract all .zip files into a single directory. Matlab .m scripts will process the raw data files, outputting the figures found in the manuscript. Run scripts on with a monitor with 4k resolution to ensure proper scaling of figure elements.  

Any code file can be edited to take other inputs just by changing the annotated pre-initialisation conditions in the first section of the .m file. Any code with "Baseliner" in the title is used to do the curve fitting operations specified in the methods section of the paper.
